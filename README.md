## Unsupervised Learning - Identify Customers Segments

## Project description
This project uses real-life data provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. I use here supervised learning to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to identify customer base of the company. As usually with real-life data, before supervised learning could be applied, I had to inspect and clean the data so they are prepared for machine learning algorithm.

## Data
There were four files associated with this project. 
Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
Data_Dictionary.md: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.
AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv: Summary of feature attributes for demographics data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns

I completed this project as a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.
